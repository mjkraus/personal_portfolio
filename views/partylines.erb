          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Party L/nes is an exercise in interactive storytelling. This approach to reporting draws me in because it utilizes web design in a cinematic way. Through interactive storytelling, I wanted to explore design and data visualization as a way to enhance a userâ€™s experience with a narrative.</p>  
      
          <p>The project is based on the article <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/07/the-top-10-reasons-american-politics-are-worse-than-ever/">The top 10 reasons American politics are so broken</a>, written by Jonathan Haidt and Sam Abrams. I also used a blurb from <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/#about-the-data">Pew Research Center</a>, along with Haidt and Abrams words, to enhance the introduction paragraph.</p>

          <h3>Layout</h3>
          <p>As Haidt and Abrams article is a list, my original thought was to create dividers using the headers of each point. Shown in my wireframes, these dividers would not only highlight the headers, but symbolically act as the lines between the two political parties. However, I quickly realized that these blocks disrupted the flow of the design and narrative. I decided to increase the fonts size and underlined the points in order to set them apart from the rest of the content.</p>

          <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
          <p>I wanted to enhance the with the article, so I developed a game in JavaScript that is included at the end of the article. I initially took 10 quotes from candidates on and presented them to the user without of who the quote comes from. The user agrees or disagrees with the quote. It displays at the end of the that The display of the final content is hopefully to make one question where he/she stands. That their lines may not be divided as though they seem. After I revised the game to only be six questions, as ten was too many for most users to get through.</p>

          <h3>Game</h3>
          <p>The data in this piece gave me the opportunity to work with data visualization. I redesigned several of the charts in the article and made them interactive using the JavaScript library highcharts.js. I also included two sparklines in the introduction paragraph using another library, sparklines.js.</p>
